EmailJS allows you to send emails directly from the frontend without a backend server.

### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account

2. Sign up for a free account (up to 200 emails/month)

### Step 2: Add Email Service

2. Click "Add New Service"
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Follow the setup instructions to connect your email account
5. Note down your **Service ID**

### Step 3: Create Email Template
1. Go to "Email Templates" in your dashboard
2. Click "Create New Template"
3. Use this template content:

```
Subject: New Discs4Bros Signup - {{from_name}}

Hello,

You have a new signup for Discs4Bros exclusive access!

Name: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Message: {{message}}

This signup came from the Discs4Bros landing page.

Best regards,
Discs4Bros Landing Page
```

4. Save the template and note down your **Template ID**

### Step 4: Get Public Key
1. Go to "Account" â†’ "API Keys"
2. Copy your **Public Key**

### Step 5: Update Configuration
1. Open `src/emailConfig.js` in your project
2. Replace the placeholder values:

```javascript
export const emailConfig = {
  serviceId: 'your_actual_service_id',
  templateId: 'your_actual_template_id',
  publicKey: 'your_actual_public_key'
}
```

### Step 6: Test the Form
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Fill out the form on your landing page
3. Check if the email arrives at bros@discs4bros.com

## Option 2: Alternative Backend Solutions

If you prefer a backend solution, here are other options:

### Netlify Forms (if hosting on Netlify)
- Add `netlify` attribute to your form
- No additional setup required

### Formspree
- Free tier available
- Simple form endpoint setup

### Custom Backend
- Node.js with Nodemailer
- Python with Flask/Django
- PHP contact form

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Service ID not found"**
   - Double-check your service ID in EmailJS dashboard
   - Make sure the service is active

2. **"Template not found"**
   - Verify your template ID
   - Ensure template is saved and published

3. **"Unauthorized"**
   - Check your public key
   - Make sure your domain is allowed in EmailJS settings

4. **Emails not arriving**
   - Check spam/junk folders
   - Verify the destination email (bros@discs4bros.com)
   - Test with a different email address first

### Testing Tips:

1. Start by testing with your own email address
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Use EmailJS test feature in their dashboard
4. Monitor EmailJS usage in your dashboard

## Security Notes

- The public key is safe to use in frontend code

- Consider adding a simple captcha for production use

## Next Steps

Once email is working:
1. Consider adding email validation
2. Set up email analytics/tracking
3. Create welcome email sequences
4. Add email list management
